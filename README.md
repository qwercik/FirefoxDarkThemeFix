# Firefox dark theme fix
## Description
Simple fix for Firefox for dark Linux themes. The problem was poor visibility of text in inputs and textareas.
## Usage
Clone this repository.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/qwercik/FirefoxDarkThemeFix.git
``` 

Now change your directory

```bash
$ cd FirefoxDarkThemeFix
```

Then grant execution permissions to the *firefox-fix.py*.

```bash
$ chmod +x firefox-fix.py
```

Eventually run *firefox-fix.py*

```bash
$ ./firefox-fix.py
```

## Problems
The code work correctly with default installation of Firefox 53 on Linux Mint 18.1 Cinnamon and Manjaro 17.0.1.
The author is not sure that the patch will work correctly on other distributions and older Firefox versions.
